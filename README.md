# Exercise: Integrate the Bank
## Overview
Problem Statament
BankCo is small African bank that has two data sources served by APIs. They would like you, the Integration Engineer, to write a small script that will integrate their two data sources and prepare a few CSV summaries. The two datasets are:

A JSON list of transactions: https://df-dev.bk.rw/interview01/transactions
An XML list of customers: https://df-dev.bk.rw/interview01/customers

The project primary goal is to go through the general data analysis process, so the project report is including four parts: 
- questions asking 
- data wrangling 
- exploratory data analysis 
- conclusion
